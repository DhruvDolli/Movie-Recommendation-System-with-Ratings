# Introduction

The **FlickAI**ðŸŽ¬ (Movie Recommendation System) is an intelligent application designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences using streamlit. 

  This project is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past ratings and preferences. By leveraging both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, the system can suggest movies that align with the user's tastes.
 
 Whether you are a casual viewer looking for your next favorite film or a developer interested in recommendation algorithms, this project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning in real-world scenarios.
